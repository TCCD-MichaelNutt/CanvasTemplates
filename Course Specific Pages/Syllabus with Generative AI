<h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>
<p><em>Be sure students know how long they should expect to wait for grading feedback on assignments. Individualized and specific feedback&nbsp;is part of Regular and Substantive Interaction (RSI) in a distance learning course and must be addressed.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Late Work Policy</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>Avoid zero tolerance policies</strong>. Our focus is on student success, and because mistakes, life events, or confusion can prevent any of us from timely submissions, we recommend policies in keeping with a more student-focused philosophy. For example:</em></p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Consider point deductions for late major assignments in favor of &ldquo;no late work&rdquo; policies, which typically do not serve our students well.</em></li>
    <li><em>Consider allowing students to re-write major essays to improve their scores. Writing is a process, and as writers, we improve with practice. Teaching students this process and&nbsp;allowing them to learn from their own errors and from your feedback can be valuable. To that end, be sure to provide students with timely feedback so that they may be able to apply that feedback on future assignments.</em></li>
    <li><em>Students who have plagiarized essays should be handled in accordance with TCCD policy.&nbsp;This policy includes a range of consequences, from a mandatory rewrite to failure for the course. Create a clear policy that outlines the types of plagiarism and how they will be handled in your class, and when doing so consider policies that include scaled responses based on the kind of plagiarism, the intent of the student, and what would benefit the student in their learning process.&nbsp; For more, please see the plagiarism policy included in this document.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Participation Policy</strong></h2>
<p><em>Be sure students know what your participation expectations are. Considerations are synchronous session attendance/participation instead of discussion boards or assignments.

            <h3><strong>TCC District Attendance Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>Regular and punctual class attendance is expected at Tarrant County College. Student absences will be recorded from the first day the class meets. In case of absence, it is the student's responsibility to contact the instructor. Students absent on official school business are entitled to make up coursework missed. In all other cases, the instructor will judge whether the student will be permitted to make up work and will decide on the time and nature of the makeup. However, the student is expressly responsible for any work missed regardless of the cause of the absence. The student must discuss such work with the instructor and should do so immediately on returning to school. communication between the student and instructor is most important, and it is the student's responsibility to initiate such communication. If students do not appear at the prearranged time or meet the prescribed deadline for makeup work, they forfeit their rights for further makeup of that work.</p>
            <p>Students who stop attending class for any reason should contact the instructor and the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.tccd.edu/admission/admissions-registrar-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Registrar's Office</a> to withdraw officially from the class. Failure to withdraw officially may result in a failing grade for the course.</p>
            <p>Class attendance and participation are essential to student success. The following attendance guidelines apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A student in an on-campus course missing a cumulative of 15 percent of the class meetings <strong>and</strong> not keeping up with the course assignments may be dropped <strong>at the discretion of the instructor.</strong></li>
                <li>A student in an online course is required to complete successfully the online course orientation<strong> and </strong>actively participate in the course as described in the Instructor's&nbsp;Course Requirements (ICR).<strong> </strong>A student not meeting these requirements may be dropped<strong> at the discretion of the instructor.&nbsp;</strong></li>

            <p>Note: LockDown Browser only needs to be installed once per computer or device. It will start automatically from that point forward when a test requires it.</p>
            <p>To take an online test, start LockDown Browser and navigate to the exam. (You won't be able to access the exam with a standard web browser.) For additional details on using LockDown Browser, review this <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.respondus.com/downloads/RLDB-QuickStartGuide-Instructure-Student.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Quick Start Guide</a>(PDF)</p>
            <p>Finally, when taking an online exam, follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select a location where you won't be interrupted</li>
                <li>Before starting the test, know how much time is available for it, and that you've allotted sufficient time to complete it</li>
                <li>Turn off all mobile devices, phones, etc. and don't have them within reach</li>
                <li>Clear your area of all external materials &mdash; books, papers, other computers, or devices</li>
                <li>Remain at your desk or workstation for the duration of the test</li>
                <li>LockDown Browser will prevent you from accessing other websites or applications; you will be unable to exit the test until all questions are completed and submitted</li>
            </ul>

        <strong><u>Title IX</u> Responsible Employee</strong>
        <p>&ldquo;I am designated as a R<em>esponsible Employee</em><span>&nbsp;</span>when it comes to reporting Sexual Misconduct. That means I am required by law to report sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking against a student or employee to the Title IX Coordinator. TCCD cares about the safety of our employees and students and has created this requirement because interpersonal violence in all forms is unacceptable, and we&rsquo;re committed to holding perpetrators accountable and keeping reporting parties safe. Your privacy is of utmost importance, and we will strive to protect your privacy to the extent possible while complying with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as TCCD policy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><strong>Confidential Reporting Option</strong></p>
        <p>If you desire that details of the incident be kept confidential, you should speak with on-campus counselors or off-campus rape crisis resources, who will maintain confidentiality. Campus counselors are available to help you free of charge.&nbsp;</p>
