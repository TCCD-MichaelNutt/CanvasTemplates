<p>To kick off our course and foster a sense of community, we'd like to get to know one another in a fun and engaging way. Please take a moment to introduce yourself and participate in the "Two Truths and One Lie" game.</p>
<h3><strong>Part 1: Introduction</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>Start by telling us a bit about yourself:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your name (or preferred username).</li>
    <li>Where you are from or currently residing.</li>
    <li>Your major or field of study.</li>
    <li>What inspired you to join this course or program?</li>
    <li>Any specific academic or career goals you hope to achieve during your studies.</li>
    <li>A fun or interesting fact about yourself.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Part 2: Two Truths and One Lie</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>Now, let's have some fun with the game! Share three statements about yourself, but here's the twist: two of these statements should be truths, and one should be a cleverly crafted lie. Be creative in your approach! It's up to your fellow students to guess which one is the lie.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I've traveled to 15 different countries.</li>
    <li>I can play the flute.</li>
    <li>I once won a grape smashing contest.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the lie is that the I have traveled to 15 different countries. Try to make your lie tricky but not too obvious!</p>
<p>After posting your introduction and "Two Truths and One Lie" statements, respond to at least two of your fellow students by guessing which statement is the lie, or commenting on interesting facts you discover about your peers. Let's make our online learning environment a fun and interactive space. Enjoy the game!</p>
