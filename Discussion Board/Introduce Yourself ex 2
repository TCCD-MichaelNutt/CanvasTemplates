<p><span><strong>Using the letters of your name as acronyms, let us get to know you by describing a little bit about yourself.</strong></span></p>
<p>For example, Susan describes herself as:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>S &mdash; Smart. I may not excel in math, but I am smart in my own way!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>U &mdash; Unique. I am unique, but mind you, aren't we all!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>S &mdash; Sensitive. I tend to be sensitive about the world around me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A &mdash; Abnormal. Some people say I am abnormal because I think school is so much fun, I would go there even during the weekends! Well, maybe I&rsquo;d have to think about the weekend part :)</p>
<p>N &mdash; Neat. I appreciate it when things are neat and organized.</p>

<p>When you're ready to post your discussion board, click "Reply&rdquo; below to start a new post. Tell us your name then respond to the above-stated questions. Each question must be thoroughly addressed in your response.&nbsp; Be&nbsp; descriptive, and use specific examples.</p>
<p>Discussion board posts should be 250 words minimum in length&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;discussion.&nbsp; After writing your post, be sure to review and edit before clicking "Submit."</p>
<p>After posting your response,&nbsp;respond thoughtfully to at least<strong>&nbsp;one&nbsp;</strong>of your classmates&nbsp;to complete this assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t be able to access your classmates&rsquo; posts until&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;you have submitted your response to the discussion board.&nbsp; At this point you can click &ldquo;Reply&rdquo; to a classmate&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Choose at least<strong>&nbsp;one&nbsp;</strong>of the discussion board entries made by other students in the class and reply to their statement with 250 words&nbsp;in length. Share your thoughts with them about their ideas.</p>
<p>Your classmate responses must start with a salutation (Example: "Hi John:"&nbsp; so I can see who you are responding to) followed by the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span><strong>Why do you agree or disagree with their perspective?</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>What do you think is important about what they&rsquo;ve offered to the discussion board for this topic?</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>What did they say that resonated with you or your experience and why?</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Keep in mind that a simple response of "I agree" or "I disagree" without a thorough explanation is insufficient and may result in no credit given for those entries.</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Instead, respond as you would if you were having an academic conversation with a fellow classmate in real-time (this would mean politely, of course.) Failure to follow the rule for polite discourse may also result in a zero on your own discussion board assignment.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Discussion boards should exhibit significant thought and include content&nbsp;</strong>with supporting data, references to the text and/or secondary information, articles/websites that relate to the content, cite current events that are relevant, post personal experiences, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Since we are remote&nbsp;-&nbsp;this is the best way we can communicate with one another as both presenting and learning from our peers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Think of of this as a "getting to know" each other class exercise. Since we are in a distance learning situation, we do not get to connect in the same way that face to face courses do.&nbsp;</p>
