<p>To kick off our course and foster a sense of community, we'd like to get to know one another in a fun and engaging way. Please take a moment to introduce yourself and participate in the "Two Truths and One Lie" game.</p>
<h3><strong>Part 1: Introduction</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>Start by telling us a bit about yourself:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your name (or preferred username).</li>
    <li>Where you are from or currently residing.</li>
    <li>Your major or field of study.</li>
    <li>What inspired you to join this course or program?</li>
    <li>Any specific academic or career goals you hope to achieve during your studies.</li>
    <li>A fun or interesting fact about yourself.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Part 2: Two Truths and One Lie</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>Now, let's have some fun with the game! Share three statements about yourself, but here's the twist: two of these statements should be truths, and one should be a cleverly crafted lie. Be creative in your approach! It's up to your fellow students to guess which one is the lie.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I've traveled to 15 different countries.</li>
    <li>I can play the flute.</li>
    <li>I once won a grape smashing contest.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the lie is that the I have traveled to 15 different countries. Try to make your lie tricky but not too obvious!</p>
<p>After posting your introduction and "Two Truths and One Lie" statements, respond to at least two of your fellow students by guessing which statement is the lie, or commenting on interesting facts you discover about your peers. Let's make our online learning environment a fun and interactive space. Enjoy the game!</p>

<p>When you're ready to post your discussion board, click "Reply&rdquo; below to start a new post. Tell us your name then respond to the above-stated questions. Each question must be thoroughly addressed in your response.&nbsp; Be&nbsp; descriptive, and use specific examples.</p>
<p>Discussion board posts should be 250 words minimum in length&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;discussion.&nbsp; After writing your post, be sure to review and edit before clicking "Submit."</p>
<p>After posting your response,&nbsp;respond thoughtfully to at least<strong>&nbsp;one&nbsp;</strong>of your classmates&nbsp;to complete this assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t be able to access your classmates&rsquo; posts until&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;you have submitted your response to the discussion board.&nbsp; At this point you can click &ldquo;Reply&rdquo; to a classmate&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Choose at least<strong>&nbsp;one&nbsp;</strong>of the discussion board entries made by other students in the class and reply to their statement with 250 words&nbsp;in length. Share your thoughts with them about their ideas.</p>
<p>Your classmate responses must start with a salutation (Example: "Hi John:"&nbsp; so I can see who you are responding to) followed by the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span><strong>Why do you agree or disagree with their perspective?</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>What do you think is important about what they&rsquo;ve offered to the discussion board for this topic?</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>What did they say that resonated with you or your experience and why?</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Keep in mind that a simple response of "I agree" or "I disagree" without a thorough explanation is insufficient and may result in no credit given for those entries.</strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Instead, respond as you would if you were having an academic conversation with a fellow classmate in real-time (this would mean politely, of course.) Failure to follow the rule for polite discourse may also result in a zero on your own discussion board assignment.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Discussion boards should exhibit significant thought and include content&nbsp;</strong>with supporting data, references to the text and/or secondary information, articles/websites that relate to the content, cite current events that are relevant, post personal experiences, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Since we are remote - this is the best way we can communicate with one another as both presenting and learning from our peers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Think of of this as a "getting to know" each other class exercise. Since we are in a distance learning situation, we do not get to connect in the same way that face to face courses do.&nbsp;</p>
